      "description": "Hi, I’m extreme meteorologist and storm chaser, Reed Timmer, known for embedding myself into some of the most severe weather storms and scenarios imaginable, so that I can research, report and warn others before natural disasters strike.\n\nWhile most prefer to avoid the bad news that comes with bad weather, I charge towards it; intercepting tornadoes and hurricanes with my armored vehicle, the SRV Dominator, and launching trackable meteorological sensors into their strongest winds. My team has deployed probes into tornadoes using drones, small aircraft, and even rockets, gathering measurements never-before-recorded on earth. Documenting all things related to atmospheric science is my passion.\n\nI’ve been featured on the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, Netflix, The Weather Channel, Disney, PBS, AccuWeather and more! I’ve been featured on Jay Leno’s Garage, and worked with the legendary Richard Hammond, from Top Gear & Grand Tour. It’s insane where my weather career has taken me.\n",
